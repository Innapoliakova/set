Here is a draft About page for the CodeYourFuture asset manager app:

# About Asset Manager

Asset Manager aims to provide an organized way for CYF trainees and staff to discover, share, and integrate graphical assets into their projects. 

## The Problem

CYF trainees frequently need images, icons, and other graphics for building websites and apps. Relying on external stock resources is time-consuming. A centralized platform to upload, manage, and distribute internal assets is needed.

## Key Features

- User accounts and roles 
- Upload images and graphics
- Add keywords and categories
- Browse and search assets
- Download assets 

## Roles & Permissions

**Trainees** can browse assets and integrate them into projects.

**Mentors** can also upload new assets to share.

**Staff** review assets to ensure proper licensing.

## Stretch Goals

- User collections to organize assets
- JSON API access to collections

By providing an intuitive platform tailored to CYF's needs, Asset Manager aims to make finding and integrating visuals easy, organized, and legal.

Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand this About page draft further. I tried to capture the core problem, solution, features, and roles that define the asset manager project.
